How it works?
=====================

The way to create a NGSI resource is fairly simple:
1. Firstly you have to access to the resource create section and choose the option Link.

2. Fill the URL field with a Context Broker query, if your query is a convenience operation, you only have to fill the URL field with it. If instead, it is a standard operation query, you have to do an additional step after create the resource in order to add a payload to de query. You can control the results pagination at the same way that in a common Context Broker query.

3. Complete the Format field with ngsi9 or ngsi10 and click on add resource. This is an important step, and without it the extension won’t do anything with your resource.

4. Finally set the OAuth-token field to required if you are working with Orion ContextBroker at http://orion.lab.fiware.org:1026. Additionally you can also manage the [tenant](https://forge.fiware.org/plugins/mediawiki/wiki/fiware/index.php/Publish/Subscribe_Broker_-_Orion_Context_Broker_-_User_and_Programmers_Guide#Multi_service_tenancy) and the [service path](https://forge.fiware.org/plugins/mediawiki/wiki/fiware/index.php/Publish/Subscribe_Broker_-_Orion_Context_Broker_-_User_and_Programmers_Guide#Entity_service_paths) as the same way that it is explained at Orion Context Broker documentation. If your query is a convenience type, your resource has already been created, on the contrary if it is a standard operation you have to do the next step.

5. Standard operations only: Click on manage to edit your resource, now an additional field has appeared, complete it with a payload and click on update to save your query payload.
